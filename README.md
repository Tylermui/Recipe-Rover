# Setting up .env file
To properly use and run this project, you must create a config.js file within the project's static folder. Inside the file, name two variables "export const API_ID" = //your_API_id and "export const API_KEY" = //your_api_key. This will allow the index.js file to import the key and id from the API and allow for proper searching.
